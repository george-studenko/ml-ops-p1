# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
Implements a library of code to train models to predict customer churn.

The main objective of this project is to refactor the code in a Jupyter Notebook following clean code concepts,
to use it in scripts in order to be able to automate tasks in the future and deploy it to production.

## Running Files
To run the project follow the instructions below:

1. Create a virtual environment with:  
```python -m venv venv```
   
2. Activate the environment with:  
```source venv/bin/activate```  
   
3. Install the requirements with:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
4. Execute the tests to run all functions in the library with:  
```python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py```
   
Note: running ```churn_script_logging_and_tests.py``` 
can take several minutes since it will include training 2 different models. 
There will be a couple of lines indicating the tests started and when the process finished.

Once the process is over images from the process will be found inside the ```images``` folder and logs inside the ```logs``` folder.
